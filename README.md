Built with Processing https://processing.org/

Interactive interface for displaying user data(such as word and message counts) from the files sent from discord after requesting your user data

In order to use include the "messages" folder from the discord data package in the same folder as the program. 

First run discord_parser.py, which creates two JSON files for processing to use to display the data
